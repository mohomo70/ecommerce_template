# ADR-001: Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to decide on the initial architecture for our e-commerce platform. The team is considering between a monolithic architecture and a microservices architecture.

## Decision
We will start with a monolithic architecture using Django REST Framework for the backend and Next.js for the frontend.

## Rationale

### Why Monolith First
1. **Team Size**: Small development team (2-3 developers)
2. **Development Speed**: Faster initial development and deployment
3. **Simplicity**: Easier debugging, testing, and monitoring
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Lower infrastructure costs
5. **Data Consistency**: ACID transactions across all modules

### Why Not Microservices Initially
1. **Complexity**: Requires more operational overhead
2. **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
3. **Distributed System Challenges**: Network partitions, eventual consistency
4. **Team Maturity**: Requires DevOps expertise for service orchestration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster time to market
- Simpler deployment and monitoring
- Easier to maintain data consistency
- Lower operational complexity
- Better for small teams

### Negative
- Potential scaling bottlenecks
- Technology lock-in
- Larger codebase to maintain
- Harder to scale individual components

## Migration Path
We will design the monolith with clear module boundaries to enable future migration to microservices:
- Separate Django apps for each domain
- Well-defined API contracts
- Event-driven architecture where possible
- Database per service preparation

## Review Date
This decision will be reviewed when:
- Team size grows to 10+ developers
- Individual services need different scaling requirements
- Performance bottlenecks emerge
- Business requirements demand independent deployments
